#### vs Roberto

The plan was to do a double-leg takedown and go from there. We started to fight standing and I didn't feel like I was in a good position to go for it. I began to get tired fast. Two times I did dive for it, the first time he defended and we recovered to a standing position, the second time he rolled over and I had him in a closed guard on the ground. It was counted as a takedown and he was given 2 points for it. We sat in a closed guard until the end. Lost by points 0-2.

Lessons:

- Shoot for more takedowns. Get more tries. Stick to the game plan
- Stand up if they shoot for you because takedown is 2 points even if the position is bad for the initiator
- Don't just grip the neck while standing but put pressure as well, which helps to prepare for dive-ins
- Be more calm to prevent getting washed out in the first 2 min

#### vs Matias

My first Gi fight that was after a week of training in Gi. Was able to calm down by listening to rhythmic music just before the beginning of the fight. Oppo jump-guarded me but I felt comfortable and started to get out. He took my arm and armbared me very quickly so my arm crunched 3 times before I managed to tap. It was on 0:32.

I felt like the skill gap was too wide to actually do anything.

#### vs Juan

My first ever jiu-jitsu competition. Was super nervous. As I practiced very little wrestling so decided to pull guard almost immediately. After some defending from the ground, opponent just jumped on me in mount and was trying to choke me. I was able to shrimp out and retain guard, but it was already around 2 minutes into the fight and I was super washed out. After some time he did exactly the same thing and then he ezekieled me at 4:25.

Problems:

- Very nervous
- Lost steam after 2 minutes into the fight
- Couldn't defend nor attack from guard

Lessons:

- Try starting a fight standing, even when they will try to get me down I might fall in guard at the bottom
- Learn how to defend from guard (or not sit at all)
- Learn some wrestling basics

## Brain dump

It is an incomplete attempt to dump sequences I practiced in classes. Colored cards are positions, connections between cards are transitions and clouds are finishes.

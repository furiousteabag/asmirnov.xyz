Best startup ideas commons:

- founders want themselves
- founders can build
- few other realize it is worth doing

Live in the future and build what seems interesting. Strange as it sounds, that's the real recipe.

## Problem

- Work on problems which exists
- Bad ideas may sound plausible
- If the feedback from target audience is not negative it doesn't mean idea is bad

- When startup launches there should be users who wants the product urgently
- Tradeoff: big audience but average interest vs small audience with high interest
  - choose latter
- It is hard to see how the small niche idea will become big

## How to get ideas

- live on the edge of the field does not only mean to push it forward but you might be a user
  - "Live in the future, then build what's missing"
  - "Live in the future and build what seems interesting"
- **not think up but notice**
- turn on **whats missing** and turn off "could this be big?"
- pay attention to thing that annoy you
- loose mind and pay attention to gaps and anomalies
- build thing that are cool because it is not interesting to build something already existing

## Studying

- it is easier to spot problems in unrelated fields
- beware of research, because research problems are far aways from real users problems

## Competition

- worrying that you are too late is a sign of a good idea
- focus on users not competitors
- it is promising if you are entering the crowded market where everybody is missing something you know
- strategy
  - huge market but with secret sauce
  - small market which could be extended

## Filters

- turn off schlep filter
  - when something seems difficult, messy and hard to work with
  - many people fear to deal with those problems (e.g. Stripe and payment processing)
- turn off unsexy filter
  - these are problems you don't like, not interested

## Recipes

Coming up with ideas on demand

- come up with idea that you really need
- "would you use that thing if you hadn't written it?"
- "Why doesn't someone make x? If someone made x we'd buy it in a second."
- try to sell bad idea and collect feedback
- talk to everybody about gaps in the world to find others unmet needs
  - what is tedious or annoying?
- if found someone else' issue try to solve problems for exactly that person
- bypass schelp and unsexy filters
  - seek out ideas that are unsexy or involve schleps
  - "what you wish someone else would build, so that you could use it. What would you pay for right now?"
- startup garbage-collecting broken companies and industries
  - try to imaging how to profit from that, try to ask that as if you were in the future
- small niches is fine because big players don't pay attention to it

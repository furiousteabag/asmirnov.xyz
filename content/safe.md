## General

Tools

- captable.io

Definition

- Simple Agreement for Future Equity
- investor gives money now for a promise to give shares on a priced round

Things to negotiate on?

- amount of money
- valuation cap
  - amount / valuation cap = guaranteed ownership even if company raises more

Difference with debt?

- debt has an interest rate
- debt needs to be repaied

Anatomy

- Section 1: events
  - Equity financing
  - Liquidity event
    - company might get sold
  - Dissolution
    - company is closed
  - Liquidation priority
    - who comes first to be repaid
  - Termination
    - SAFE terminates if something above happened
- Section 2: definitions
- Section 3: company representation
  - company represented correctly
- Section 4: investor representation
- Section 5: legal boilerplate that has to be there

Post-money

- after all the safes
- pre-money valuation + money raised = post-money valuation
  - $5m + $1m = $6m
- amount raised / post-money valuation cap = ownership
  - $1m / $6m = 16.67%

Other different saves

- discount instead of valuation cap
  - e.g. 20% discount on shares in priced round
- uncapped SAFE
  - just the ability to get shares on priced round at the same price as investors
  - unpopular
- uncapped with "Most Favored Nation"
  - don't agree on cap right now
  - if other investors are investing I get the best deal among those

## Dilution

On priced round ($5M invested on $15M pre-money) 3 thing happen

1. safes convert
   - On new rounds we do not transfer our shares but we create new shares
   - When SAFE convertes, we dilute current shares by multiplying ownage percentage by (1 - investor ownership)
   - 5% and 10% based on the valuation in the cap (if a priced round is higher than cap in the SAFE)
   - if a priced round is lower it means that investor will have higher percentage
   - so if a cap is really high (e.g. $10M and they put $100k, they would normally get 1%) but if you raise later on $5M valuation it converts to 2%

|  **SAFE Investor B**  |                   |      1,176,470       |   10%   |
|   **Total Issued**    |    10,000,000     |      11,764,705      |  100%   |

2. option pool is increased

   - increase option pool for future employees

3. new inverstor invest

   - Capitalizations = total fully-diluted share after SAFE conversion and the option pool increase)
     - 10M + 1.76M (SAFEs convert) + 1.695M (option pool increase) = 13.455M
   - Price per share = Pre-money Valuation / Capitalization
     - $15M / 13.455M shares = $1.114
   - Number of shares = investment amount / Price per share
     - $5M / $1.114 = 4.48M

## Tips

- don't overoptimize on caps
- negotiation is hard and effect is not that large
- $800k on $10m vs $8m post-money cap: founders own 52.77% instead of 51.54%

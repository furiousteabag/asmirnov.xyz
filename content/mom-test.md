## The Mom Test

Truth seeking is a main thing. It is like excavating a archaelogical site. Every question may bias the person so answers would be irrelevant. Asking wrong question is worse than doing nothing at all, because when you know you're clueless, you tend to be careful.

Usefulness of a conversation is whether it gives concrete facts about customers' lives and world views.

**Rules**:

1. Talk about their life instead of your idea
2. Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or optinions about the future
3. Talk less and listen more

### Good/bad questions

| Question | Good/Bad | Reasoning |
| :------: | :------: | :-------: |

| "Do you think it's a good idea?" | ❌ | Opinions are worthless. Only the market can tell if idea is good. ^[Say you’re building an app to help construction companies manage their suppliers. You might ask them to show you how they currently do it. Talk about which parts they love and hate. Ask which other tools and processes they tried before settling on this one. Are they actively searching for a replacement? If so, what’s the sticking point? If not, why not? Where are they losing money with their current tools? Is there a budget for better ones? Now, take all that information and decide for yourself whether it’s a good idea.] |
| "Would you buy a product which did X?" | ❌ | Anything involving the future is an over-optimistic lie ^[Ask how they currently solve X and how much it costs them to do so. And how much time it takes. Ask them to talk you through what happened the last time X came up. If they haven’t solved the problem, ask why not. Have they tried searching for solutions and found them wanting? Or do they not even care enough to have Googled for it?] |
| "How much would you pay for X?" | ❌ | People will lie to you if they think it’s what you want to hear ^[Just like the others, fix it by asking about their life as it already is. How much does the problem cost them? How much do they currently pay to solve it? How big is the budget they’ve allocated?] |
| "What would your dream product do?" | ❌ | Sort-of-okay, but only with follow-ups. People know what their problems are, but they don’t know how to solve those problems. ^[The value comes from understanding why they want these features. You don’t want to just collect feature requests. You aren’t building the product by committee. But the motivations and constraints behind those requests are critical.] |
| "Why do you bother?" | ✅ | Points toward their motivations |
| "What are the implications of that?" | ✅ | Some problems exist but don't actually matter. This question helps to distinguish between I-will-pay-to-solve-that problems and thats-kind-of-annoying-but-I-can-deal-with-it "problems" |
| "Talk me through the last time that happened." | ✅ | Watching someone do a task will show where the problems and inefficiencies really are, not where the customer thinks they are |
| "Talk me through your workflow." | ✅ | Same |
| "What else have you tried?" | ✅ | If they haven't looked for ways of solving it already, they're not going to look for (or buy) yours |
| "Would you pay X for a product which did Y?" | ❌ | It is about the future where people are overly optimistic. It is about your idea instead of their lives. If far along, ask for money ^[Ask about what they currently do now, not what they believe they might do in the future. Common wisdom is that you price your product in terms of value to the customer rather than cost to you. That's true. And you can't quantify the value received without prodding their financial worldview] |
| "How are you dealing with it now?" | ✅ | While it’s rare for someone to tell you precisely what they’ll pay you, they’ll often show you what it’s worth to them. |
| "Where does the money come from?" | ✅ | Necessary to figure out decision maker. Especially important in B2B context |
| "Who else should I talk to?" | ✅ | Should work by default. Not working if you screwing up the meeting or they don't care about the problem |
| "Is there anything else I should have asked?" | ✅ | People want to help you, but will rarely do so unless you give them an excuse to do so. Discard it as you get better at asking good questions and knowing the industry |

### Using the mom test

Deciding what to build is your job. You do that by figuring out customer's problems, cares, constraints, and goals. You aren’t allowed to tell them what their problem is, and in return, they aren’t allowed to tell you what to build. They own the problem, you own the solution.

## Avoiding bad data

Bad data gives us false positives and false negatives about the idea. Types:

1. Compliments
2. Fluff (generics, hypotheticals, and future)
3. Ideas

### Deflect compliments

Compliments are almost certainly lying. Try to avoid them completely but if they happen ignore them.

**You don't need to end up with what you wanted to hear. You need to get to the truth.**

### Anchor fluff

3 types of fluff:

- Generic claims ("I usually", "I always", "I never")
- Future-tense promises ("I would", "I will")
- Hypothetical maybes ("I might", "I could")

Always get back to specifics.

Avoid triggering fluff answer by avoiding:

- "Do you ever..."
- "Would you ever..."
- "What do you usually..."
- "Do you thing you..."
- "Might you..."
- "Could you see yourself..."

You may use those to transition to concrete questions

### Dig beneath ideas

Startups are about focusing and executing on a single, scalable idea rather than jumping on every good one. When you hear feature request/idea, you should understand which motivation led to it. Ask questions like this to do so:

- "Why do you want that?"
- "What would that let you do?"
- "How are you coping without it?"
- "Do you think we should push back the launch add that feature, or is it something we could add later?"
- "How would that fit into your day?"

If people feeling emotional, just let them speak:

- "Tell me more about that."
- "That seems to really bug you -- I bet there's a story here."
- "What makes it so awful?"
- "Why haven't you been able to fix that already?"
- "You seem pretty excited about that -- it's a big deal?"
- "Why so happy?"
- "Go on."

So ideas and feature requests should be understood, but not obeyed.

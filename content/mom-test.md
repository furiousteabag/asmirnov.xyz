## The Mom Test

Truth-seeking is the main thing. It is like excavating an archaeological site. Every question may bias the person so answers would be irrelevant. Asking the wrong question is worse than doing nothing at all because when you know you're clueless, you tend to be careful.

The usefulness of a conversation is whether it gives concrete facts about customers' lives and world views.

**Rules**:

1. Talk about their life instead of your idea
2. Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future
3. Talk less and listen more

### Good/bad questions

| Question | Good/Bad | Reasoning |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| "Do you think it's a good idea?" | ❌ | Opinions are worthless. Only the market can tell if the idea is good. ^[Say you’re building an app to help construction companies manage their suppliers. You might ask them to show you how they currently do it. Talk about which parts they love and hate. Ask which other tools and processes they tried before settling on this one. Are they actively searching for a replacement? If so, what’s the sticking point? If not, why not? Where are they losing money with their current tools? Is there a budget for better ones? Now, take all that information and decide for yourself whether it’s a good idea.] |
| "Would you buy a product which did X?" | ❌ | Anything involving the future is an over-optimistic lie ^[Ask how they currently solve X and how much it costs them to do so. And how much time it takes. Ask them to talk you through what happened the last time X came up. If they haven’t solved the problem, ask why not. Have they tried searching for solutions and found them wanting? Or do they not even care enough to have Googled for it?] |
| "How much would you pay for X?" | ❌ | People will lie to you if they think it’s what you want to hear ^[Just like the others, fix it by asking about their life as it already is. How much does the problem cost them? How much do they currently pay to solve it? How big is the budget they’ve allocated?] |
| "What would your dream product do?" | ❌ | Sort of okay, but only with follow-ups. People know what their problems are, but they don’t know how to solve those problems. ^[The value comes from understanding why they want these features. You don’t want to just collect feature requests. You aren’t building the product by committee. But the motivations and constraints behind those requests are critical.] |
| "Why do you bother?" | ✅ | Points toward their motivations |
| "What are the implications of that?" | ✅ | Some problems exist but don't matter. This question helps to distinguish between I-will-pay-to-solve-that problems and that's-kind-of-annoying-but-I-can-deal-with-it "problems" |
| "Talk me through the last time that happened." | ✅ | Watching someone do a task will show where the problems and inefficiencies really are, not where the customer thinks they are |
| "Talk me through your workflow." | ✅ | Same |
| "What else have you tried?" | ✅ | If they haven't looked for ways of solving it already, they're not going to look for (or buy) yours |
| "Would you pay X for a product which did Y?" | ❌ | It is about the future where people are overly optimistic. It is about your idea instead of their lives. If far along, ask for money ^[Ask about what they currently do now, not what they believe they might do in the future. Common wisdom is that you price your product in terms of value to the customer rather than cost to you. That's true. And you can't quantify the value received without prodding their financial worldview] |
| "How are you dealing with it now?" | ✅ | While it’s rare for someone to tell you precisely what they’ll pay you, they’ll often show you what it’s worth to them. |
| "Where does the money come from?" | ✅ | Necessary to figure out decision maker. Especially important in B2B context |
| "Who else should I talk to?" | ✅ | Should work by default. Not working if you screwing up the meeting or they don't care about the problem |
| "Is there anything else I should have asked?" | ✅ | People want to help you, but will rarely do so unless you give them an excuse to do so. Discard it as you get better at asking good questions and knowing the industry |

### Using the mom test

Deciding what to build is your job. You do that by figuring out customer's problems, cares, constraints, and goals. You aren’t allowed to tell them what their problem is, and in return, they aren’t allowed to tell you what to build. They own the problem, you own the solution.

## Avoiding bad data

Bad data gives us false positives and false negatives about the idea. Types:

1. Compliments
2. Fluff (generics, hypotheticals, and future)
3. Ideas

### Deflect compliments

Compliments are almost certainly lying. Try to avoid them completely but if they happen ignore them.

**You don't need to end up with what you wanted to hear. You need to get to the truth.**

### Anchor fluff

3 types of fluff:

- Generic claims ("I usually", "I always", "I never")
- Future-tense promises ("I would", "I will")
- Hypothetical maybes ("I might", "I could")

Always get back to specifics.

Avoid triggering fluff answers by avoiding:

- "Do you ever..."
- "Would you ever..."
- "What do you usually..."
- "Do you think you..."
- "Might you..."
- "Could you see yourself..."

You may use those to transition to concrete questions

### Dig beneath ideas

Startups are about focusing and executing on a single, scalable idea rather than jumping on every good one. When you hear a feature request/idea, you should understand which motivation led to it. Ask questions like this to do so:

- "Why do you want that?"
- "What would that let you do?"
- "How are you coping without it?"
- "Do you think we should push back the launch to add that feature, or is it something we could add later?"
- "How would that fit into your day?"

If people are feeling emotional, just let them speak:

- "Tell me more about that."
- "That seems to really bug you -- I bet there's a story here."
- "What makes it so awful?"
- "Why haven't you been able to fix that already?"
- "You seem pretty excited about that -- it's a big deal?"
- "Why so happy?"
- "Go on."

So ideas and feature requests should be understood, but not obeyed.

### Stop seeking approval

Compliments are dangerous. So it is better to avoid situations when they may occur.

If you've mentioned your idea, people will try to protect your feelings.

### Cut off pitches

Anyone will say your idea is great if you're annoying enough about it.

### Talk less

Even if they are talking about something you've already thought of.

## Asking important questions

Unexpected answers are really important and should affect what you're doing. You should be asking questions that have the potential to destroy an imagined business.

For unpleasant tasks, you can imagine what you would have someone else do if you were delegating it. Then do that.

### Love bad news

Do not avoid important truths. We are not selling, we are learning. "meh" response is more reliable than a "Wow!" one.

### Look before you zoom

Avoid being stuck in details before understanding the big picture. You could get a lot of details of a problem that a person does not care about.

When it is not clear whether a problem is a must-solve-right-now (e.g. selling a painkiller) or a nice-to-have (e.g. selling a vitamin) it is possible to clarify via questions like this (for example with personal blog):

- "How seriously do you take your blog?"
- "Do you make money from it?"
- "Have you tried making more money from it?"
- "How much time do you spend on it each week?"
- "Do you have any major aspirations for your blog?"
- "Which tools and services do you use for it?"
- "What are you already doing to improve this?"
- "What are the 3 big things you're trying to fix or improve right now?"

Start broad and don't zoom in until you've found a strong signal, both with your whole business and with every conversation.

### Look at the elephant

Sometimes we fall to asking questions that don't actually de-risk the business or resolve those critical, big, scary, lurking questions.

There are two types of risks:

- Product risk: can I build it? can I grow it? will they keep using it?
- Market risk: do they want it? will they pay? Are there enough of them?

Do not overlook one or the other. Videogames, for example, are a pure product risk. If more product risk maybe start building earlier.

### Prepare your list of 3

Pre-plan the 3 most important things you want to learn.

## Keeping it casual

There are suggestions to separate meetings into 3 to avoid bias: the first about the customer and their problem; the second about your solution; and the third about selling a product. But the first one doesn't even have to be a meeting. Learning about a customer and their problems works better as a quick and casual chat than a long, formal meeting.

### The meeting anti-pattern

Do not try to relegate every opportunity for customer conversation into a calendar block. It sets expectations. Reduce it from a meeting to a chat. Leave room for the unexpected. Symptoms of formality:

- "So, first off, thanks for agreeing to this interview. I just have a few questions for you and then I'll let you get back to your day..."
- "On a scale of 1 to 5, how much would you say you..."

At their best, conversations are a pleasure for both parties. If it feels like they're doing you a favor by talking to you, it's probably too formal.

### How long are the meetings?

Early conversations are very fast. Chat grows longer as you move from the early broad questions ("Is this a real problem?") towards more specific product issues. It takes 5 minutes to learn whether a problem exists and is important. Learning how someone achieves a certain goal is quick as well. Scheduling and going to a meeting has a lot of overhead for a 10-minute chat. Just leave the idea out.

### Putting it together

Keep it casual even in more formal meetings. Give as little information as possible about your idea while nudging the discussion in a useful direction.

## Commitment and advancement

Once we've learned the key facts about the industry and customers, it's time to zoom in again and start revealing ideas and show some products. But compliments! To distinguish we may ask for commitment in some form or for an advancement.

Not trying to convince anybody. If they don't care we can leave. But we have to put them to a decision in order to get the answer. Symptoms of a bad meeting:

- A pipeline of zombie leads
- Ending product meetings with a compliment
- Ending product meetings with no clear steps
- Meetings that "went well"
- They haven't given up anything of value

Two concepts of moving forward:

- Commitment: They are showing they're serious by giving up something they value such as time, reputation, or money
- Advancement: They are moving to the next step of the real-world funnel and getting closer to a sale

"Customers" who keep being friendly but aren't ever going to buy are a particularly dangerous source of mixed signals.

### Meetings succeed or fail

If you don't know what happens next after a product or sales meeting, the meeting is pointless.

### The currencies of conversation

Compliments aren't data because they don't cost anything.

Time commitment:

- Clear next meeting with known goals
- Sitting down to give feedback
- Using a trial themselves for a non-trivial period

Reputation risk commitments might be:

- Intro to peers or team
- Intro to a decision-maker
- Giving a public testimonial or case study

Financial commitments:

- Letter of intent (non-legal but gentlemanly agreement to purchase)
- Pre-order
- Deposit

The more they're giving up, the more seriously you can take their kind words.

### Good meeting / bad meeting

| Phrase | Good/Bad | Reasoning |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| "That's so cool. I love it!" | ❌ | Compliment. Zero data. Obviously fluff. Deflect it and get back to business |
| "Looks great. Let me know when it launches." | ❌ | Compliment plus a stalling tactic. Find a commitment to ask for today to make a signal clear, for example, an introduction or push to an alpha user. |
| "There are a couple of people I can introduce you to when you're ready." | ❓ | Some data, but it is too generic. Clarify what "ready" is and who he wants to introduce to. |
| "What are the next steps?" | ✅ | Need to know what the next steps are. |
| "I would definitely buy that." | ❌ | Shift from promises into concrete current commitments. |
| "When can we start a trial?" | ❓ | Depends on what starting a trial means for them. If it is a big effort then good. What are they giving up to try it out? |
| "Can I buy the prototype?" | ✅ | Rare. |
| "When can you come back to talk to the rest of the team?" | ✅ | In case of B2B. |

### How to fix a bad meeting

Meeting that you leave with neither rejection nor advancement. Won't learn anything until I take the next step. Maybe pushing for a commitment at the end while you receive compliments. But don't be annoying, you aren't trying to get into their wallet. You are trying to cut through polite rejections.

Q: aren't polite rejections bad already?

### Don't pitch blind

Even product-focused sales meetings start with open-ended learning. Hard pitching gives binary feedback whether you nailed it or you didn't. That's not ok for big questions like if anybody cares about your product at all.

### Crazy customers and your first sale

Buying from a startup is already weird. First customers are crazy in some way. They really, really want what you're making. It is good to keep an eye out for the people who get emotional about what you are doing. These might be early evangelists:

- Have a problem
- Know they have a problem
- Have the budget to solve the problem
- Have already cobbled together their own makeshift solution

They might give you money even for pre-orders and duct-tape prototypes. If someone isn't emotional it's pretty unlikely that they are crazy enough to be the first customer.

In early-stage sales, the real goal is learning. Revenue is just a side effect.

## Finding conversations

### Going to them

1. Cold calls

   The goal of cold calls is to stop getting them by treating the first one or two respectfully trying to solve their problem and getting warm intros from them.

2. Seizing serendipity

   Sounds weird to unexpectedly interview people but you should think of a conversation instead. People love talking about themselves and their problems. Don't make excuses about why you are there or mention that you are starting a business. Just have a good conversation.

3. Find a good excuse

   For example "Hello, I'm doing my PhD research on a problem around X and it would be a huge help if I could ask you a couple of questions"

   If it's a topic you both care about, find an excuse to talk about it. Your idea never needs to enter the equation and you both will enjoy the chat.

4. Immerse yourself in where they are

5. Landing pages

   Get your product out there, collect emails, and reach out.

### Bringing them to you

When you are finding ways to have conversations, you're on the back foot. You approached, so they are suspicious and trying to figure out if you're trying to waste their time.

1. Organise meetups
2. Speaking & teaching

   Conferences, workshops, online videos, blogging, consulting, office hours.

3. Industry blogging

4. Get clever

   Business-specific hacks.

### Creating warm intros

These are the goals.

1. 7 degrees of bacon

   Research the network.

2. Industry advisors

   They might create incredible intros. They might come from early customer conversations.

3. Universities

   Professors are easy to reach out and they get grant funding from high-level industry folks.

4. Investors

5. Cash in favours

   Everybody who said "Keep me in the loop and let me know how I can help"

   You are going to be ignored a lot, but so what? **You aren't trying to minimize failure rate; you are trying to get conversations going**.

### Asking for and framing the meeting

It might be unclear what the meeting is for. So it is important to frame it:

1. You're an entrepreneur trying to solve horrible problem X, usher in wonderful vision Y, or fix stagnant industry Z. Don't mention your idea.
2. Frame expectations by mentioning what stage you're at and, if it's true, that you don't have anything to sell.
3. Show weakness and give them a chance to help by mentioning the specific problem that you're looking for answers to. This will also clarify that you're not a time waster.
4. Put them on a pedestal by showing how much they, in particular, can help.
5. Ask for help.

Or, in shorter form: Vision / Framing / Weakness / Pedestal / Ask

### To commute or to call

Better to start in person.

### The advisory flip

Be with a mindset of looking for advisors instead of customers.

### How many meetings

Keep having conversations until you stop hearing new stuff.

## Choosing your customers

### Segmentation

Every company starts small, otherwise it is too generic; the marketing message is generic.

If you have a fuzzy sense of who you're serving, you end up talking to a lot of different types of people, which leads to 3 problems:

- You get overwhelmed by options and don't know where to start
- You aren't moving forward but can't prove yourself wrong
- You receive incredibly mixed feedback and can't make sense of it

Talking to an industry expert can provide a taxonomy of the industry.

If you aren't finding consistent problems and goals, you don't yet have a specific enough customer segment.

### Customer slicing

Start with a broad segment and ask:

- Within this group, which type of person would want it most?
- Would everyone within this group buy/use it, or only some of them?
- Why do they want it? (e.g. What their problem or goal)
- Does everyone in the group have that motivation or only some of them?
- What additional motivations are there?
- Which other types of people have these motivations?

Having those answered, we will have segments and motivations. How to find them:

- What are these people already doing to achieve their goals or survive their problems?
- Where can we find our demographic groups?
- Where can we find people doing the above workaround behaviors?

If groups are unfindable then slice into finer pieces. Now that we have those, we may start with the most:

1. Profitable
2. Easy to reach
3. Rewarding for us to build a business around

Good customer segments are a who-where pair. If you don't know where to go to find your customers, keep slicing your segment until you do.

### Talking to the wrong people

3 ways to do so:

1. You have too broad of a segment and are talking to everyone
2. You have multiple customer segments and missed some of them
3. You are selling to businesses with a complicated buying process and have overlooked some of the stakeholders

## Running the process

It is a bad pattern for a single guy to do all the meetings and tell everybody what to do because it's easy to misinterpret what customers say.

Symptoms of a learning bottleneck:

- "You just worry about the product. I'll learn what we need to know."
- "Because the customers told me so!"
- "I don't have time to talk to people -- I need to be coding!"

### Prepping

Ensure you know your current list of 3 big questions. Scary questions should be there as well. If some questions could be answered using desk research -- do it.

Questions to unearth hidden risks:

- "If this company fails, what is most likely to have killed it?"
- "What would have to be true for this to be a huge success?"

We are trying to figure out:

- "What do we want to learn from these guys?"

If you don't know what you're trying to learn, you shouldn't bother having the conversation.
